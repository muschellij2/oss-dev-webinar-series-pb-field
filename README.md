## Webinar Series for Open Source Software & Algorithm developer's in the physical behaviour research field

We use this repository to collect ideas for webinar topics and to keep a record past and upcoming meetings.

The webinar series aims to:
- Provide a platform for research software/algorithm developers to meet each other.
- Support each other in research software development challenges.
- Raise awareness and understanding of each otherâ€™s work
- Work towards improved Open Source Software (OSS) re-use, compatibility, and quality in the field.
- Advocate OSS in the community.
- Be open to any programming expertise level.
- One webinar per month, typically 1 hour.
