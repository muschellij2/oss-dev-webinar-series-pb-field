## Webinar Series for Open Source Software & Algorithm developer's in the physical behaviour research field

We use this repository to collect ideas for webinar topics and to keep a record of past and upcoming meetings.

The webinar series aims to:
- Provide a platform for research software/algorithm developers to meet each other.
- Support each other in research software development challenges.
- Raise awareness and understanding of each other’s work
- Work towards improved Open Source Software (OSS) re-use, compatibility, and quality in the field.
- Advocate OSS in the community.
- Be open to any programming expertise level.
- One webinar per month, typically 1 hour, format flexible, e.g. lecture, discussion, tutorial.

### Rules of conduct:
- If you do not make your (main) code Open Source, then we would rather not have you in this group.
- Bad software or algorithms do not exist in this group. Feedback should always be constructive, and nobody should feel afraid to present their work.
- Everything discussed in this group is not confidential, unless the presenter explicitly asks for confidentiality.
- We adhere to the Open Source license definitions, where code that comes with an open source license can be used by others as specified by the license.
